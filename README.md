## Notes

The application was initially designed as a prototype, so we chose to write the program in SwiftUI, which is a fast shaping programing language. Although the application is getting pretty well developed now, there are some bottlenecks in the development of the project due to some features of the technology selection and lack of maintenance as a prototype. We are currently designing a brand new application using UIKit. 

After some discussion, we decided to open source this prototype. This is probably because we will not be maintaining this prototype in the future. 

If you encounter any technical problems, you can ask in the issue. If the problem is not very serious we will not necessarily fix your problem, please consider fixing it yourself.
